# replace-all-spaces-with-dashes-in-the-value-of-an-input-field
Here's an example code snippet using jQuery to replace all spaces with dashes in the value of an input field with the ID "url" or "title" whenever either of those fields is changed:

```
$(document).ready(function() {
  // Listen for changes to the "url" and "title" input fields
  $('input#url, input#title').on('input', function() {
    // Replace all spaces with dashes in the input field's value
    var newValue = $(this).val().replace(/\s+/g, '-');
    // Set the new value for the "url" input field
    $('input#url').val(newValue);
  });
});
```

This code attaches an event listener to the "input" event for both the "url" and "title" input fields using the jQuery on method. Whenever either field is changed, the function passed to on is called.

Within the event listener function, we use the val method of the jQuery object to get the current value of the input field. We then call the replace method on that string with a regular expression that matches all occurrences of one or more whitespace characters (\s+) and replaces them with a single dash.

Finally, we set the new value of the "url" input field using the val method with the newValue variable we just created.
